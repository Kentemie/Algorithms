# This algorithm is used to find a loop in a linked list. It uses two pointers one moving twice as fast as the other one. 
# The faster one is called the faster pointer and the other one is called the slow pointer.

# Follow the steps below to solve the problem:

    # Traverse linked list using two pointers.
    # Move one pointer(slow_p) by one and another pointer(fast_p) by two.
    # If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then the linked list 
    # doesnâ€™t have a loop.
