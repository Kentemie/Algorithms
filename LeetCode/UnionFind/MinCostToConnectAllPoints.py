# You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].

# The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the 
# absolute value of val.

# Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.
